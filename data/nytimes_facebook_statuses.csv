Most of the jobs require advanced skills and are in urban areas, while most of the potential labor force is untrained and lives in rural parts of the country. India’s National Skill Development Policy for 2015 aims to narrow the gap by encouraging young Indians to migrate from their homes for training and jobs in cities.

Researchers from Evidence for Policy Design at Harvard’s Kennedy School surveyed 1,946 women and 769 men who participated in the government’s training program and found it was relatively successful in finding jobs for young men and women, but few of the trainees kept at it.

■ More than 80% of men and 70% of women received job offers after training, but only 68% of men and 56% of women accepted.

■ A year after training, only 20% of women were still working, and 35% of men.

■ Women and men dropped out for different reasons. For women, the most common reason for refusing jobs was family pressure. Men dropped out because of low pay.
